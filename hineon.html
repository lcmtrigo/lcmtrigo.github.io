          <p>HiNeon is a lighting company that makes custom neon signs using LEDs. These safe, energy-efficient, eco-friendly and durable signs are often used by business owners to attract customers and by home owners to brighten up interior spaces. HiNeon is a subsidiary of the Vancouver based lighting supplier, Lighting Geek.</p>
          <p class="margin-bottom-0">I was hired by HiNeon in September of 2017 as a web development intern to collaborate with <u><a href="http://claraaugust.com/" target="_blank">Clara August</a></u> and turn HiNeon’s existing custom LED neon sign order form into an interactive web app.</p>

          <h4 class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>How would we simplify the process of ordering a custom LED neon sign?</strong></h4><br>
          <p>During the first few days of my internship, I found out HiNeon was getting an increasing number of emails regarding LED neon sign customization. The form was key in helping HiNeon visualize what customers wanted in terms of personalized neon signage, but did a poor job in doing so. I asked myself, “how can I design an app that simplifies the entire process of ordering a custom neon sign to the point where it reduces incoming customization emails?”</p>
          <p>The form (pictured below) was lengthy and tedious. There was terminology users were not familiar with, inappropriate use of input fields and it overall wasn’t very intuitive. After using the form myself, I had figured out why users were forgoing completion of the form and directly emailing HiNeon instead.</p>

          <p>The first week of my internship mostly involved planning the information architecture and curating the user experience for the app. During this stage, I did some research to see how HiNeon’s competitors (Sygns and Nameglo) proceeded with designing an interactive custom neon sign app. My supervisor told me that it wouldn’t be enough to simply copy our competitors designs.</p>
          <p>I had to realize, as a designer, why our competitors made those decisions and how I can improve on them and tailor a unique design solution for HiNeon’s app.</p>

          <p>Clara and I met with HiNeon’s development team to discuss how we were going to build the app. We were told that the front-end had to be compatible with the content management system they use (WordPress) for their site. Also, Clara and I had to be realistic with our coding skill levels in a sense that we had to be comfortable with the front-end technology we would be using to the point where we can build the app with it in three weeks. Because of this, we steered away from robust frameworks like Angular and React and stuck to pure JavaScript (and some jQuery).</p>
          <p>GitHub was primarily how we organized and shared our code. It was a learning experience for me in terms of collaborating with other developers and a refresher on version control principles and best practices. In addition to coding, I prepared graphics and image assets for the app and even did some copywriting.</p>

          <h4 class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>As a junior designer, expect to wear many hats</strong></h4><br>
          <p>It quickly became clear that I was doing different kinds of work at HiNeon than I had signed up for. I was doing UX/UI design instead of working with MySQL databases and PHP. I was preparing image assets and copywriting rather than fixing bugs on the company’s website. My biggest takeaway from this 144-hour internship is that it helps to have a good balance of web design and coding in your skill set.</p>
          <p>Overall, I was very impressed with what Clara and I were able to accomplish throughout our time working at HiNeon. We designed and built a digital product that has been through numerous client meetings and code reviews. We were able to showcase a lot of skills we learned at BCIT. Most importantly, we gained experience working with a real client which we can carry over in our future career endeavours.</p>
          <p>The HiNeon custom sign app is currently in the hands of their back-end development team and is expected to launch live on their site in January.</p>
