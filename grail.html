          <p>Grail is a community and marketplace app dedicated to men’s fashion. The goal of the app is to make highly sought after clothing available and affordable to the general public. All of the items available on Grail are secondhand, which not only makes the app’s catalog highly curated, but also sets those items at unbeatable prices.</p>
          <p>Designing an app from the ground up was a challenging and rewarding experience for me. I received feedback from both my peers at BCIT and my fashion-conscious friends who helped me user test the app. This feedback ultimately made me realize that as user experience designers, we are designing for neither ourselves or our clients. We are designing for our users.</p>

          <p>Context</p>
          <h4 class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>At the time, there was no way to easily and reliably buy and sell clothing online</strong></h4><br>
          <p>In summer of 2013, my friends and I joined a social media group dedicated to buying and selling sneakers. We would occasionally snoop for things we liked and would even sell our own shoes when we wanted to save up money. We noticed an issue which plagued this group and others similar to it; the high probability of encountering flakers.</p>
          <p>Flaking is the <i>last minute</i> withdrawal from a sale or purchase with a meeting time and location already arranged. Flakers in our social media group were removed and heavily shunned by the other members. It would often escalate to the point where these people would get into personal arguments.</p>
          <p class="margin-bottom-0">What if there was a way to buy and sell clothing online without having to meet up at a physical location?</p>

      <!-- User flow-->

        <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 margin-top-45 line-height-1-8"><hr class="my-hr section-hr"></div>

          <p>User flow</p>
          <h4 class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>Sometimes, you gotta go with the flow</strong></h4><br>
          <p>I was already familiar with flow charts during this stage of the app because of my computer science roots. I applied my previous knowledge into creating the user flows for Grail, keeping in mind that the flow chart had to be anchored upon the notion of how a human would think, rather than a computer.</p>
          <p >draw.io was my software of choice when making this flow chart. What I liked about it was the simplicity, integration with Google drive, and the ability to export your chart into a PNG, XML or PDF file.</p>

          <h4 class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>It’s like role playing but for UX designers</strong></h4><br>
          <p>One of my favourite genres of video games is the JRPGs from the late 90s. You were given a character with certain traits and abilities as well as an interior motive. You interacted with other characters in an open environment as you fulfill that interior motive and complete the overall story.</p>
          <p>User scenarios allow me to exercise this style of storytelling. Creating user profiles is similar to creating a character. The scenario is the overall motive. User testing is the live manifestation of this character and the completion of the story done in an evaluative 21st century way.</p>

          <p>Paper prototyping</p>
          <h4 class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>I started with the design tool I best knew how to use, my hands</strong></h4><br>
          <p>I was skeptical of paper prototyping at first. I though it seemed childish, as if I was in the third grade playing with arts and crafts. Why do I need to build a paper prototype when I can go straight to Sketch or Illustrator? What if people can’t read my handwriting or even worse, criticize my drawing skills?</p>
          <p>I quickly came to realize that paper prototyping was fast, iterative and cheap. I did five paper screens in the time it took me to do one screen in Sketch. I played around with materials to determine how I can represent features commonly found in mobile apps such as scrolling and loading bars. I was able to build a basic yet functional version of my app, spending only a few dollars on common office materials and without having to open a single application.</p>

          <h4 class="margin-bottom-0"><strong>So it’s like beta testing but for a mobile app instead of a video game?</strong></h4><br>
          <p>I had to find the right person to test my paper prototype on; someone who’s fashion conscious and doesn’t work in tech field. My friend (heard in this video) seemed to fit the bill. He quickly grasped the app’s concept and how it works. He even ventured into features of the app that I had yet to build, expecting them to work. Needless to say, his feedback was invaluable and helped me design the app in the right direction.</p>

          <p>One of my colleagues from BCIT participated in this user test this time around. Although he didn't fit the description I had sought in my first test, he did give some substantial feedback which also helped in the design of the app. Here's some of the things he noticed:</p>
          <p>Home Screen</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make it more obvious that there are fashion articles on top of the home screen</li>
            <li>Provide screens for the rest of the items and the menu icons</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>Item screen</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Arrange or remove some of the information on the top so that it looks less cluttered</li>
            <li>Arrange the gallery and the purchase buttons in a way so it doesn’t take up the entire screen.</li>
            <li>Include an inclination to scroll down</li>

          <p>This stage of the design process felt like the last leg of the race. Everything I had done led me to this moment. I had a clear vision from the beginning of what this app does and how it works. I had refined my concept through user flow charts. I created a target audience and a hypothetical scenario in which they would use the app. I hand-crafted a paper prototype and tested it with real people. I carried this prototype over to Sketch and ran more user tests. The time had finally come to create a high fidelity prototype which I can share with other people.</p>

          <p>In the end, I created a user interface which visually represented all the qualities I was seeking: sleek, minimalist and classy. I realized just how much work goes into designing an app and that none of the stages in the design process can be skipped. Without flowcharts and information architecture, it’s easy for users to get lost within your app. Without user profiles and scenarios, there’s no way to find out what users want. Without usability testing, there wouldn’t be a way to see how users would react to you app until launch.</p>
          <p>When I show someone my prototype and that person says, “I would totally use this app if it were real” I take a moment to enjoy the fruits of my labor.</p>
